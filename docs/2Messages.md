# 2. How to change in-app messages

A file located in `/src/generic/messages/messages.properties` contains all in-app messages that can be customized. The file is used both by the plugin and Onegini BaseApp. 

The file contains messages in "KEY=VALUE" format, with one line per message. Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.
